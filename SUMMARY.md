# 🎯 Image Display Issue - Root Cause & Fix Summary

## Investigation Summary

**Product affected:** `https://www.jeffy.co.za/products/1761261890214`  
**Issue:** Product images not displaying on site  
**Status:** ✅ Root cause identified, fix provided

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Problem:**  
Supabase Storage bucket (`product-images`) is missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies that allow public read access.

**Technical Details:**
- Images upload successfully to Supabase Storage ✅
- Image URLs are saved correctly in database ✅
- Frontend code attempts to load images ✅
- **Supabase RLS blocks public access** ❌

Even though the bucket is marked as "public", Supabase requires explicit SELECT policies for anonymous users to view/read objects.

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Quick Fix (30 seconds):

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Public Access to Product Images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');
```

### What This Does:
- Allows anyone (including anonymous users) to SELECT (read/view) objects
- Only applies to the `product-images` bucket
- Secure - read-only access, no write/delete permissions
