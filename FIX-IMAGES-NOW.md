# 🎯 IMMEDIATE FIX: Product Images Not Displaying

## ⚡ Root Cause Identified

Your product images **ARE uploading successfully** to Supabase Storage, but they're **blocked from public viewing** due to missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## 🚀 THE FIX (30 seconds)

### Copy and Run This SQL:

1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select:** Your "jeffy" project  
3. **Click:** "SQL Editor" (left sidebar)
4. **Click:** "New Query"
5. **Paste this:**

```sql
-- Fix product image access
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Public Access to Product Images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');
```

6. **Click:** "Run" (or Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
7. **Done!** ✅

## ✅ Verify It Worked

After running the SQL:

1. Go to: https://jeffy.co.za/products/1761261890214
2. **Image should now display!**
3. Check browser console (F12) - you should see:
   - `✅ Image loaded successfully for [Product Name]`

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

**The Issue:**
- Images uploaded successfully ✅
- Image URLs saved to database ✅
- Frontend trying to load images ✅
- **Supabase RLS policy blocking access** ❌

**Why It Happened:**
- Supabase Storage buckets use Row Level Security (RLS)
- Even "public" buckets need explicit SELECT policies
- Without the policy, anonymous users can't read/view images

**The Fix:**
- Added a SELECT policy that allows public (anonymous) access
- Policy only applies to `product-images` bucket
- Still secure - users can only READ, not modify/delete

## 🐛 If Images Still Don't Show

### Check 1: Run the SQL Again
Sometimes the policy doesn't apply the first time. Just run it again.

### Check 2: Check Supabase Logs
1. Dashboard → Logs
2. Look for "permission denied" or "policy violation" errors

### Check 3: Verify the Policy Exists
Run this SQL to check:
```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'product-images';
```
You should see at least one row with your policy.

### Check 4: Make Sure Bucket is Public
```sql
SELECT id, name, public FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'product-images';
```
The `public` column should be `true`.

## 📊 Browser Console Debugging

Now when you visit your site, open the console (F12) and you'll see helpful messages:

**When image loads successfully:**
```
✅ Image loaded successfully for Professional Compound Bow
   - Image URL: https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/product-images/product-...jpg
   - Type: Supabase Storage URL
```

**When image fails:**
```
❌ Image failed to load for Product Name
   - URL: https://...
   - Error: 403 Forbidden
   - Image exists but may have CORS/permission issues
```

This will help you diagnose any remaining issues.
