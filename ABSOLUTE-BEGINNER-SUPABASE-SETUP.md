# üöÄ Supabase Setup - ABSOLUTE BEGINNER GUIDE
## (Like you've never used a computer before!)

---

## ü§î **What is Supabase?**
**Think of it like this:** Your website is like a restaurant, and Supabase is like a **permanent kitchen** where you store all your ingredients (products). Right now, your ingredients disappear every time the restaurant closes. Supabase makes them **stay forever**.

  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT DEFAULT '',
  price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  original_price NUMERIC,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  images TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  videos TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  rating NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
  review_count NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
  in_stock BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **STEP 6: Update Your Website**
1. **Go back to your project folder** (where your website code is)
2. **Find the file called** `.env.local`
3. **Open it** (double-click)
4. **You'll see two lines that look like this:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```
5. **Replace the fake values** with your real ones:
   - Replace `https://your-project-id.supabase.co` with your **Project URL**
   - Replace `your-anon-key-here` with your **Anon public key**
6. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

### **STEP 7: Upload to Internet**
1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt** (search for it)
2. **Type these commands one by one** (press Enter after each):
