## üìã Required: Supabase Setup

Your application needs Supabase to store products and images permanently. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Fill in:
   - **Project Name**: jeffy-shop (or any name)
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save it!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to you
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for project setup

### Step 2: Get API Keys

1. Once project is created, go to **Project Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
2. Click **API** in the left menu
3. You'll see:
   - **Project URL** (starts with https://)
   - **anon/public key** (starts with eyJ...)
   - **service_role key** (starts with eyJ..., keep this secret!)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and replace the values:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ... (your anon key)
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ... (your service role key)
   ```

### Step 4: Create Database Table

1. In Supabase dashboard, click **SQL Editor** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy all contents from `supabase-setup.sql` file
4. Click **Run** to execute
5. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 5: Create Storage Bucket

1. In Supabase dashboard, click **Storage** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create a new bucket**
3. Set:
   - **Name**: `product-images`
   - **Public bucket**: ‚úÖ Enabled
   - **File size limit**: 10MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: 
     - image/jpeg
     - image/jpg
     - image/png
     - image/webp
4. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 6: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it:
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Testing the Fix

### Test on Desktop:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/login
2. Login with your admin credentials
3. Click any category (e.g., Electronics, Sports, Home-Garden)
4. Click the green "Add Product" button
5. Fill in product details and upload an image
6. Click "Create Product"
7. Product should appear in the category and on the products page

### Test on Mobile:
1. Find your computer's local IP address:
   - Windows: `ipconfig` (look for IPv4)
   - Mac/Linux: `ifconfig` or `ip addr` (look for inet)
2. On your phone, go to: `http://YOUR-IP:3000/admin/login`
3. Follow the same steps as desktop
4. Images should upload successfully

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Supabase not configured" error
- Check that `.env.local` file exists
- Verify all three environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure there are no spaces or quotes around the values
- Restart your dev server after changing .env.local

### Images not uploading
- Verify the `product-images` bucket exists in Supabase Storage
- Check that the bucket is set to **Public**
- Ensure service role key is set in .env.local
- Check browser console for specific error messages

### Products not appearing
- Verify the `products` table exists in Supabase
- Check that `display` column is set to `true` for the product
- Try clicking the "Refresh" button on the products page

### Mobile upload fails
- Ensure phone is on same WiFi network as computer
- Try reducing image file size (under 5MB recommended)
