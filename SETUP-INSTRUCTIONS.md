# üöÄ Jeffy Project - Fixed Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **Created `.env.local` file** - Supabase configuration file with placeholder values
2. **Fixed Supabase connection handling** - Better validation and fallback mode
3. **Fixed product upload scripts** - Better error handling and response processing
4. **Added product ID to API responses** - Ensures uploads return correct product IDs

## üéØ Current Status

Your project now works in **FALLBACK MODE** - products are stored in memory and will persist until you restart the server. To enable permanent storage, follow the Supabase setup below.

## üìã Option 1: Quick Start (No Database)

If you just want to test the app without setting up Supabase:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 3. Upload a product (in a new terminal)
node upload-product.js
```

**Note:** Products will be stored in memory and reset when you restart the server.

## üìã Option 2: Full Setup (With Supabase Database)

For permanent product storage:

### Step 1: Create Supabase Account

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project" and sign up
3. Create a new project called "jeffy"
4. Wait 2 minutes for the database to initialize

### Step 2: Set Up Database Table

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the contents of `supabase-setup.sql` file from this project
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"**
5. ‚úÖ Your products table is created!

### Step 3: Set Up Storage for Images

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Click **"New Bucket"**
3. Create bucket with these settings:
   - Name: `product-images`
   - **Public bucket:** ‚úÖ Check this box
   - File size limit: 10 MB
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/webp`
4. Click **"Create bucket"**

**OR** skip this step - the app will auto-create the bucket on first upload!

### Step 4: Get Your API Keys

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy these three values:
   - **Project URL** (example: `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon/Public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Service Role key** (also starts with `eyJ...`) - **Required for image uploads!**

### Step 5: Update Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

3. Save the file

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to copy all THREE keys, especially the service role key!

### Step 6: Deploy Environment Variables to Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add all three variables (same as in `.env.local`)
5. Select **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** for each
6. Click **Save**

### Step 7: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Start it again
npm run dev
```

You should see: `‚úÖ Supabase properly configured` in the console

## üß™ Testing Product Upload

### Test 1: Upload the Sample Product

```bash
node upload-product.js
```

This will upload a sample "Premium Illuminated Archery Nocks" product.

### Test 2: Quick Upload Custom Product

```bash
node quick-upload.js "Camping Backpack" "camping" "79.99" "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1622260614927-189e28e3fb7f?w=800"
```

### Test 3: Check the Admin Dashboard

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard
2. You should see your uploaded products

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution:** Make sure the dev server is running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Problem: "Supabase not configured"
**Solution:** Check your `.env.local` file has valid Supabase credentials (not placeholder values)

### Problem: Products disappear after restart
**Solution:** You're in fallback mode. Set up Supabase for permanent storage.

### Problem: Image uploads fail
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure service role key is set in `.env.local` 
2. Check `SUPABASE-STORAGE-COMPLETE-SETUP.md` for detailed guide
3. Verify bucket exists or let app create it automatically

### Problem: Upload script shows fetch error
**Solution:** Make sure you're using Node.js 18+ (check with `node --version`)

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Test the upload scripts** to make sure they work
2. **Set up Supabase** for permanent storage (optional but recommended)
3. **Upload your products** using the upload scripts
4. **Customize the app** to match your brand

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your Supabase credentials are correct
3. Make sure the development server is running
4. Check that Node.js version is 18 or higher
