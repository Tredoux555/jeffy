# 🚀 Jeffy Project - Fixed Setup Instructions

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Created `.env.local` file** - Supabase configuration file with placeholder values
2. **Fixed Supabase connection handling** - Better validation and fallback mode
3. **Fixed product upload scripts** - Better error handling and response processing
4. **Added product ID to API responses** - Ensures uploads return correct product IDs

## 🎯 Current Status

Your project now works in **FALLBACK MODE** - products are stored in memory and will persist until you restart the server. To enable permanent storage, follow the Supabase setup below.

## 📋 Option 1: Quick Start (No Database)

If you just want to test the app without setting up Supabase:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 3. Upload a product (in a new terminal)
node upload-product.js
```

**Note:** Products will be stored in memory and reset when you restart the server.

## 📋 Option 2: Full Setup (With Supabase Database)

For permanent product storage:

### Step 1: Create Supabase Account

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project" and sign up
3. Create a new project called "jeffy"
4. Wait 2 minutes for the database to initialize

### Step 2: Set Up Database Table

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the contents of `supabase-setup.sql` file from this project
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"**
5. ✅ Your products table is created!

### Step 3: Get Your API Keys

1. Go to **Settings** → **API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy these three values:
   - **Project URL** (example: `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
   - **Anon/Public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
   - **Service Role key** (also starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

3. Save the file

### Step 5: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Start it again
npm run dev
```

You should see: `✅ Supabase properly configured` in the console

## 🧪 Testing Product Upload

### Test 1: Upload the Sample Product

```bash
node upload-product.js
```

This will upload a sample "Premium Illuminated Archery Nocks" product.

### Test 2: Quick Upload Custom Product

```bash
node quick-upload.js "Camping Backpack" "camping" "79.99" "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1622260614927-189e28e3fb7f?w=800"
```

### Test 3: Check the Admin Dashboard

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard
2. You should see your uploaded products

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution:** Make sure the dev server is running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Problem: "Supabase not configured"
**Solution:** Check your `.env.local` file has valid Supabase credentials (not placeholder values)

### Problem: Products disappear after restart
**Solution:** You're in fallback mode. Set up Supabase for permanent storage.

### Problem: Upload script shows fetch error
**Solution:** Make sure you're using Node.js 18+ (check with `node --version`)
